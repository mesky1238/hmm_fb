### The meaning of parameters taken by function `forward()`:

`init` is the initial probality, `A` is the transition probality, `B` is the log scale emisson probablity:  

  * $A = T*K*K$ array with transition probabilities, from row to column
  * $B = T*D*K$ matrix with elements $ab_{ij} = P(y_i|s_j)$
  * $init = N*K$ vector with initial probabilities
  
where

  + T = total number of time points
  + K = number of states
  + D = dimension of observations (D>1 is multivariate)
  + N = number of participants

`ntimes` is the length of each independent HMM chains, `homogeneous=TRUE,useC=TRUE,na.allow=TRUE` these parameters are not used inside the function, just to keep the same format as the [original one](../code/fb.R).

### run function `forward()`:

```{r forward, echo=TRUE}
load("../data/hmm.toy.Rd")
source("../code/HMM-func-forward.R")
forward(init, A, B, ntimes, return.all=FALSE, homogeneous=TRUE,useC=TRUE,na.allow=TRUE)
```
